It divides the population into 3 compartments: Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered. <br><br>It models the propagation of an epidemic (defined by parameters), over time, in a two-dimensional discretized space. The model takes into account the spatial heterogeneity of population density, using density functions or matrices.",
